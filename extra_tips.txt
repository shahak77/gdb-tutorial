Now that you've solved all the exercises, here are some extra gdb tips:

1. If you're debugging an executable that runs gtest, gtest will catch any exception
thrown and display it as a failure. This is annoying because we want gdb to break
on the line that throwed the exception. To disable this gtest feature, simply set
the environment variable GTEST_CATCH_EXCEPTIONS to 0

2. If your executable has arguments (that needs to be given in the command line),
in order to run the executable you will need to add the flag --args and then the
gdb will run everything you gave to him as a shell command (this means you can also
define environment variables this way). For example: gdb --args rm -rf /
